  <p>Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details:<br />
In Assignment 2, our objective was to implement a login and registration page that directed users to an invoice. Additionally, the assignment involved creating and storing user data. For more information on this assignment, please click on this <a href="https://github.com/scottg997/ITM352_F23_repo/tree/main/Garland_Scott_Assignment2">link to my assignment on GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-did-you-learn-from-this-assignment">What did you learn from this assignment?</h2>
<p>I learned a considerable amount from this assignment. One of the most significant lessons was how to transfer data between pages using a query string, which was initially quite challenging. After reviewing documentation and lab materials, I quickly understood the concept and became comfortable implementing it. Another invaluable skill I acquired was how to create and store data in a JSON file using the FS module in JavaScript.</p>

<h2 id="did-you-work-with-a-partner">Did you work with a partner?</h2>
<p>I did not work with a partner for this project; I completed it independently. My only outside assistance came from referencing lab code and consulting ChatGPT on a few challenging issues, which are duly cited in my code.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-you-get-help-when-you-needed-it">How did you get help when you needed it?</h2>
<p>Overall, the assignment was smooth, but I did encounter a challenge with maintaining the organization of query data between pages. The introduction of hidden HTML elements was confusing at first, but after reviewing several examples, I grasped its application and was able to integrate it into my project effectively. My assignment on Github offers a more detailed account of how I accomplished this.</p>

<h2 id="how-was-developing-this-assignment-different-from-assignment-1">How was developing this assignment different from Assignment #1?</h2>
<p>Developing Assignment 2 required a more thoughtful approach than the straightforward nature of Assignment 1. I had to consider various user scenarios and how to handle them, such as what would occur if a user failed to log in or if they attempted to register when they already had an account. This complexity necessitated a deeper level of planning and problem-solving.</p>

<h2 id="estimate-the-percentage-of-time-you-spent-on-various-aspects-of-the-project">Estimate the percentage of time you spent on various aspects of the project:</h2>
<p>I devoted approximately 40% of my time to planning, even going as far as to sketch the site’s logic on paper. About 50% of my effort was spent coding, which included learning new concepts and deliberating over decisions, particularly for complex requirements like IR4. The final 10% was allocated to testing and debugging, ensuring that the core logic of my site functioned correctly.</p>

<h2 id="describe-what-worked-well-with-this-project-and-what-did-not">Describe what worked well with this project and what did not.</h2>
<p>What worked exceedingly well was the visual mapping of my site’s logic on paper; it provided a clear guide and kept my development process organized. A less successful approach was overthinking certain elements, such as IR4, which I initially tried to incorporate into the invoice page. Eventually, I realized that placing it on a separate page was a more straightforward solution.</p>

<h2 id="if-you-could-go-back-in-time-what-would-you-do-differently">If you could go back in time, what would you do differently?</h2>
<p>Looking back, I would place more emphasis on the initial planning stage. Drawing a logic map on paper, though initially perceived as trivial, turned out to be significantly helpful. Emphasizing thorough planning from the beginning would have precluded the need for later revisions and changes.</p>

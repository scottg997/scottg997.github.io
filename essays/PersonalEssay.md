Why am I majoring in MIS? Initially, when I entered UH, I was not planning on majoring in anything related to computers. Before all this, I wanted to go into animal sciences and become a vet. Down the road, I discovered that I enjoyed some aspects of the major, but I could not see myself going through what was required to be a vet for the rest of my life. Because of this, I had to look for something different, but what? I was stuck for a little bit trying to figure out what I wanted to do until I talked to a family member one day. He brought up MIS and what it pertains to. Alongside my interest in working with animals, I was also really into computers and technology. Because of this, I researched what MIS was about, and it was something that I could see myself doing in my life.
Additionally, alongside this, I got a job as an IT Technician for UH Manoa, which allows me to get real-world experience in the IT world and also allows me to help pay for college. From this real-world experience, I now know that working in IT is something I enjoy. From this, I know that MIS is the major for me, and I am driven to pursue it till the end.

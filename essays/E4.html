  <p>Throughout my experience in ITM 352, I have noticed a significant improvement in my programming skills. One of the key areas of growth has been in formatting. Prior to this course, I had some programming experience, but I often struggled with organizing my code effectively, resulting in what could best be described as ‘spaghetti code.’ This made it difficult for others to understand my work. However, with the need to have my code graded, I revisited the basics of formatting and can now confidently say that my code is much more organized and presentable.
Another area where I have made strides is in my understanding of arrays. Although I was introduced to arrays in previous courses, ICS 111 and 211, I found them challenging and this impacted my grades. ITM 352 covered arrays in a more comprehensive and understandable manner, allowing me to fully grasp their functionality and apply them effectively in my programming.
Despite these improvements, there are still areas that need work. Notably, I lack confidence in my coding abilities, a sentiment stemming from struggles and poor grades in previous ICS classes. This led me to rely heavily on external resources like Stack Overflow and ChatGPT, even for tasks within my capability. Moving forward, I aim to trust in my skills more.
The Workouts of the Day (WODs) have been particularly educational, although I initially resorted to copying solutions. As the relevance of WODs to class material became apparent, I started attempting them independently. This approach was challenging and required multiple attempts, but it ultimately deepened my understanding of the concepts and made me more self-reliant in coding.
The lab sessions have been another crucial learning tool, though they varied in pace, sometimes moving too quickly or too slowly. Despite these inconsistencies, completing the labs boosted my confidence and reinforced my learning through practical application.
Assignment 1 was a challenging yet enlightening experience. I mistakenly began from scratch, not fully understanding the instructions, and struggled with unfamiliar functions and tools. After realizing this approach was flawed, I revisited lab materials and WODs, which helped me complete the assignment successfully. This experience was a valuable lesson in efficiency and understanding, preparing me for future assignments.
In terms of course improvement, maintaining a consistent pace in labs would be beneficial. Additionally, clarifying the lab materials would help in understanding them with fewer read-throughs.
The labs and collaboration with classmates have been the most beneficial aspects of this class. Engaging in labs solidified my understanding of the concepts, and working with peers made the learning process smoother. Despite the course’s challenges, it has been highly rewarding. I have even applied some of the skills learned to a website run by my family’s small business. In conclusion, this course, while demanding, has been immensely educational and valuable.</p>
